Hello,
======

I am a Master of Language Technologies student at Language Technologies Institute (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University. I am working with professor [Jamie Callan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/) on retrieval of text and image with neural net networks.

My research interest falls on information retrieval and representation learning with nerual nets.

I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), majoring in Computer Science.
